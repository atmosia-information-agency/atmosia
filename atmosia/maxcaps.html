<h2>Instructions</h2>
For any recipe in this list, usually the production steps will be as follows:
1. Produce no less gas than is mentioned in the REQ section, preferably more
2. Mix the gases in the MIX section into a pipenet, required gas percentages provided; try to be precise
2a. If mixing gases with different temperatures, consider using the atmosim -m utility for help, since gas mixers mix pressure-wise and not mol-wise
3. Heat or cool the resulting mix to the temperature outlined in the section
4. Put the resulting mix into a canister, set the canister's release pressure to what's provided in the section
5. Get the gas mentioned in the CAN section into a pipenet, heat or cool it to provided temperature (if needed)
5a. If you're heating plasma or frezon, you might want to use a radiator-based heater for it (TODO: guide)
6. Get the gas into a canister, make sure canister pressure is above what's mentioned in the CAN section
7. Fill as many empty gas tanks as you want from the MIX section gas canister; do not change the release pressure, and take care to not leak the gas
8. To prime a filled gas tank, put it into the CAN section gas canister, then fill it with max release pressure; after the time mentioned, it will explode
