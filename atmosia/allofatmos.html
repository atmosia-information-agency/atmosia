<h3>Notes</h3>
- pluoxium also behaves like 8x oxygen for breathing purposes
- the specific heats are all scaled by a factor of 1/8; this does not affect gas-gas heat transfer, but will make it so that, for example, heaters heat gas 8 times more easily than expected

<h2>All Reactions</h2>
- reactions tick every 0.5s
- unless otherwise specified, reactions always need at least 0.01mol of every gas involved
- higher-priority reactions happen first within a tick
- if unspecified, volume is in liters, pressure is in kPa, temperature is in kelvin

<h3>Plasma fire reaction</h3>
- only happens above 373.15K
- scales burn rate from 100C to 1370C
- scales plasma:oxygen ratio from 5:7 to 5:2 as temp changes from 100C to 1370C
- releases 160kJ per mole of plasma burnt
- the oxygen burnt is effectively voided; doesn't affect output
- when below 1:96 plasma:oxygen, burns plasma into trit
- when between 1:96 and 3:96 plasma:oxygen, burns plasma into a mix of CO2 and trit
- per tick, burns an amount of plasma equal to the lesser of 1/9 the plasma present or 1/90 the oxygen present
- oxygen burnt depends on amount of plasma burnt and the current burning ratio (mentioned above)
- the proportion of a plasma converted into trit linearly increases from 0% to 100% as the ratio of oxygen to plasma goes from 3:96 to 1:96 (50% at 2:96; 75% at 1.5:96)
- when above 3:96 plasma:oxygen, burns plasma into CO2
- tick priority -2

<h3>Frezon production reaction</h3>
- only happens below 73.15K
- consumes tritium and oxygen at a ratio of exactly 1:50 tritium:oxygen
- nitrogen is needed as a catalyst and is not consumed
- consumes 1/50 of available tritium-oxygen mix (5mol tritium and 666666mol oxygen is as fast as 5mol tritium and 250mol oxygen; 0.1mol tritium and 5mol oxygen will be converted)
- converts all consumed gas to nitrogen and frezon
- at lower temperatures, makes linearly more nitrogen and less frezon (at 73.15K, only makes frezon; at ~36.6K, makes 50% of both; at 23.15K, makes ~31.6% frezon; at 0K, only makes nitrogen)
- below a percentage of nitrogen, mixes slower
- the required percentage of nitrogen is 10% the amount of oxygen at 73.15K and linearly decreases at lower temperatures (would be 5% at ~36.6K and ~3.16% at 23.15K)
- tick priority 2

<h3>Tritium fire reaction</h3>
- only happens above 373.15K
- if there is less oxygen than tritium or the total thermal energy of the mixture is below 143kJ, burns tritium into water vapour at a rate equal to 1/100 of oxygen present; releases 284kJ per mole burnt
- else, burns 10% tritium, them burns an amount of oxygen equal to remaining tritium (so 1:9 T:O burn ratio); releases 2840kJ per mole of oxygen burnt
- tick priority -1

<h3>Frezon coolant reaction</h3>
- only happens above 23.15K
- speed increases linearly as temperature rises from 23.15K to 373.15K, no increase beyond that (100% speed at 373.15K, 0% speed at 23.15K, 50% speed at 198.15K)
- all following points assume full speed
- consumes 1/20 frezon present and 5 times that amount nitrogen (with 20mol frezon and 666666mol nitrogen in the mixture, it will consume 1mol frezon and 5mol nitrogen)
- converts all consumed gas to nitrous oxide
- makes 600kJ of cold per mole of frezon consumed
- at temperatures beyond 373.15K, makes cold more efficiently as if speed had gone past 100%; (consumes 1200kJ per mole (200%) at 723.15K, consumes 900kJ per mole (150%) at 548.15K); can at most reach 10 times efficiency (6000kJ per mole frezon consumed)
- tick priority 1

<h3>Ammonia-oxygen reaction</h3>
- only happens above 323.15K
- the equation for the speed of the reaction is the following:
`reaction_speed = ammonia * (ammonia / total_gas)^2 * (oxygen / total_gas)^2 / 5`
- burns an amount of oxygen and ammonia equal to reaction speed
- converts all consumed gas to an 1:3 mix of nitrous oxide and water vapour
- tick priority 2

<h3>Nitrous oxide decomposition</h3>
- only happens above 850K
- consumes half of present nitrous oxide
- per 1mol of gas consumed, makes 1mol nitrogen and 0.5mol oxygen
- tick priority 0

<h3>BZ formation</h3>
- only happens below 313.149K
- needs at least 10mol plasma and 10mol n2o
- consumes nitrous oxide and plasma, makes nitrogen, oxygen, BZ
- the reaction effectively consists of nitrous oxide decomposition and a plasma-nitrous reaction that produces BZ
- nitrous oxide decomposition:
-- happens if the ratio of nitrous to plasma is at most 1:3; if there is more nitrous, does not happen at all; the less nitrous, the more of it decomposes
-- happens in place of what would've been BZ production (the nitrous decomposes instead of being used for BZ)
-- produces 1mol nitrogen and 0.5mol oxygen for every mol of nitrous decomposed
- BZ production:
-- produces 1mol of BZ from 0.4mol of n2o and 0.8mol of plasma
- produces 200kJ of heat per 1mol of nitrous used in any way
- makes 0.01 * volume/pressure mol/s of BZ, slows down if you have less nitrous than you have plasma (1:2 ratio means slowdown to half, 1:3 ratio means to 1/3rd, more nitrous than plasma means full speed)
- (interpretation) volume matters a lot for BZ formation speed; V/P is the same as V^2/(nRT); this means BZ formation speed is proportional to volume squared and inversely proportional to moles involved and the mix's temperature
- tick priority 2

<h3>Healium production</h3>
- only happens between 22K and 300K
- needs at least 5mol frezon and 5mol BZ
- produces 3mol of healium per 2.75mol of frezon and 0.25mol of BZ
- produces 0.9*temperature healium/s
- produces 3kJ of heat per mole of healium produced
- tick priority 2

<h3>Nitrium production</h3>
- only happens above 1500K
- needs at least 10mol nitrogen, 20mol tritium, and 5mol BZ
- produces 1mol nitrium from 1mol tritium, 1mol nitrogen and 0.05mol BZ
- produces temperature/2984 nitrium/s
- removes 100kJ of heat per mole of nitrium produced
- tick priority 2

<h3>Nitrium decomposition</h3>
- only happens below 343.149K
- produces 1mol of nitrogen and 1mol of water vapour from 1mol of nitrium
- consumes temperature/2984 nitrium/s
- produces 30kJ of heat per 1mol nitrium consumed
- tick priority 2

<h3>Pluoxium production</h3>
- happens between 50K and 273.15K
- produces 1mol of pluoxium and 0.01mol of water vapour from 1mol of CO2, 0.5mol of oxygen, 0.01mol of tritium
- produces as much pluoxium as the smallest of 5mol, CO2 mols, 2x oxygen mols, or 100x tritium mols
- produces 250kJ of heat per 1mol pluoxium produced
- tick priority 3
